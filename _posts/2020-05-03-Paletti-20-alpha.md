Paletti now _posterizes_ the image into as many colors as selected (currently between 3 and 32). So the color palette will only consist of those colors that show up in the posterized image.

<span class="tag">Added</span> Change the color palette size with a slider.

<span class="tag">Added</span> Toggle between black/white and colored segmentation.

<span class="tag">Added</span> Use the _Copy_ button to put the posterized image into the clipboard.
