Paletti is now written in Vala and GTK because I primarily use Fedora now.

The new version doesn't rely on a WebView and [color-thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/) anymore, but uses [Leptonica](http://leptonica.org/) with Vala bindings to generate the color palette.

An AppImage is available from [Paletti's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Eroica/Paletti). <del>I put the old version in a separate branch.</del> <ins> <a href="https://github.com/Eroica/Paletti-Windows">An update Windows version is available here</a>.</ins>
