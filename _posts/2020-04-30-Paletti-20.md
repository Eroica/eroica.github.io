Paletti is now written in Vala and GTK.

The new version doesn't rely on a WebView and [color-thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/) anymore, but uses [Leptonica](http://leptonica.org/) with Vala bindings to generate the color palette.

The old JavaFX/WebView version is archived while I primarily use Fedora now. An AppImage is available from [Paletti's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Eroica/Paletti).
