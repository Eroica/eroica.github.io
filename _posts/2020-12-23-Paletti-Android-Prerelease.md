Paletti now has its own website: [paletti.app](https://paletti.app)

I also started developing an Android version. A pre-release is available from [Paletti's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Eroica/Paletti/releases/tag/v2.0).

The JavaFX version has been moved into this repository as well. I want to develop all three versions in tandem, giving them the same version number and features.
