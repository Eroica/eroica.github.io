Affinity Designer for some reason yielded strange results when creating a color palette from an image. I found [Alembic](https://alembicforsketch.com) and put it into a small desktop program (JavaFX).

I added a small feature so that you can scroll up and down to increase/decrease the size of the color palette (between 6 and 12).
