title: The Myth of DPI

My pet annoyance is other designers talking about "the PPI of this image" even though it's irrelevant for screen media (it's only relevant for physical media). Here for reference:

[Dpi, misunderstandings and explanation, what is dpi](http://www.dpiphoto.eu/dpi.htm)

> Any PPI requirement only makes sense if it is accompanied by a physical size, and if you're given a pixel size requirement then the PPI is irrelevant. As long as your pixel dimensions are correct then the PPI doesn't matter.

> PPI is not an inherent property of an image. There is no such thing as a 300PPI image, or a 72PPI image. PPI is just a useful measurement for determining the print size of an image.

> Which means PPI is completely irrelevant unless accompanied by physical dimensions. If someone says "Can we have that image in 300PPI?" they need to tell you a physical size in inches or centimetrs or whatever else, otherwise the question makes no sense.
